# README
The files in this directory are general purpose modules for use with several devices which I use with the Pico. These modules are used in several other projects in this repository.
The files can be placed in a ```lib``` directory on the Pico, which needs to be on the system path. On my system when I created this folder, it was automatically added to the path. When I placed files in that folder, the imports did not work. All I had to do was unplug the Pico and plug it back in, and then they worked as expected.
