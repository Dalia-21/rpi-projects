# README
The files in this directory are general purpose modules for use with several devices which I use with the Pico. These modules are used in several other projects in this repository.
The files can't be included in a package, since they are used with the Pico, which has a fairly flat directory structure. Instead, in order to make use of these libraries, copy the files to the main folder of the Pico's storage, along with the main program which makes use of them, and import classes and functions as needed.
