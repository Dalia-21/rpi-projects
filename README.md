This is a set of projects I'm working on for personal practice on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Some of these projects draw on code from other online sources, which I attribute in the source code.
The ```lib``` folder contains modules which need to be used by multiple projects, or which control specific components. Each folder contains its own README with instructions on the use of the files provided.
